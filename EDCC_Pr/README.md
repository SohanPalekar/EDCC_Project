# AQI to Cigarettes Calculator
This project is based on [work by Richard A. Muller and Elizabeth A. Muller](http://berkeleyearth.org/archive/air-pollution-and-cigarette-equivalence/). Thanks to them for working out what a cigarette is worth in terms of health-risk.

## Disclaimer
I am not a scientist or really even an academic. This is a little project I did during a weekend in the summer of 2020 when I was confined to my room because of the bad air. PRs and issues welcome - especially from real experts.

## Methods
The PM 2.5 to AQI converter uses an equation I found in the code of [this calculator](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-calculator/). The [breakpoints](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-05/documents/zell-aqi.pdf) are from the EPA. I assume that one cigarette [is equal to exposure to air pollution of 22 Î¼g/m3 for 24 hours](http://berkeleyearth.org/archive/air-pollution-and-cigarette-equivalence/).

## Technologies
AQI2Cigarettes is a static React app written in Typescript and hosted on GitHub pages. Special thanks to [GoatCounter.com](goatcounter.com) for easy privacy-forward analytics.
